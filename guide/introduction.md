# Introduction

Welcome to the Universal Materials Texture Changer (UMTC) System.

## What is UMTC?

UMTC is a comprehensive system for managing textures and materials in Second Life. It is designed to handle both modern PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials and legacy Blinn-Phong textures with equal ease.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Support**: Mix and match PBR and Non-PBR faces on the same object.
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Uses LinksetData (LSD) to store configuration, keeping script memory usage low.
- **Robust Security**: Configurable access control for Owner, Group, or Public use.
- **HUD System**: Includes a powerful HUD system for remote control (Production and Development modes).
- **API**: Extensive Link Message API for integration with other systems (e.g., AVsitter, house control systems).

## Who is this for?

This guide is for **Builders** and **Creators** who want to integrate the UMTC system into their products. If you are an end-user looking for instructions on how to use a product that contains UMTC, please refer to the documentation provided by the creator of that product.
